# Fungi model  

**Guidance:** Concentrate on the end results. When trying to answer a question, ask if the end-user will benefit from it.  
For example, suppose you want to have a dataset with many images of fungi. Ask, "Will my average user actually care about these very specific fungi?"  
If not, then you probably don't need the extra images.  

### What to do:  
Write a short report answering these questions:  

1. How many different, visible species of fungi are out there? "Visible" means that people take pictures of them and ask, "What is this fungus?" on social media. This doesn't mean the scientific number of species.  
2. How many different images of fungi in total are out there on the internet? You can estimate this roughly. For example, on iNaturalist, you can see the direct number of images, but on Reddit or Instagram, there might not be a specific number available. Instead, go to the website, scroll through 10-15 pages, and count the average number of images you seeâ€”then extrapolate that number to the full number of pages to get a rough estimate.  
3. How many of the above images, approximately, are "labeled"? That is, for how many images do you have scientific names?
